## Project status
There's a [live version](https://mergeyourmusic.laras.cc/) of this project, however my Spotify API app is still in development mode, meaning that only users that I manually add to the list of beta testers can log into the app. Contact me at tatu.laras@gmail.com if you want to be added to the list of beta testers.

## Instructions
There's a file called "sample.env" in the project root. You need to fill out the information in the file and rename it to ".env".
