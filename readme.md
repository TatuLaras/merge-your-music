## Project status
The project is more or less done, but I haven't deployed it anywhere due to Spotify shutting down my API access without an explanation. I will try to resolve this issue somehow. 

## Instructions
There's a file called "sample.env" in the project root. You need to fill out the information in the file and rename it to ".env".
